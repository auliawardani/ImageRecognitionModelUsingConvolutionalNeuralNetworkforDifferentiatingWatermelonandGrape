# Development and Evaluation of an Image Recognition Model Using Convolutional Neural Network for Differentiating Watermelon and Grape
In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented in the context of image recognition and classification, focusing on the visual differences between watermelon and grape fruits. CNN, as a deep learning architecture specialized for image processing, has proven to be very effective in extracting essential features from visual data. The results and analysis show that the CNN model provides good performance. The training and validation graphs indicate a decrease in loss and an increase in accuracy as the number of epochs increases. The model also successfully predicted the class of
watermelon and grape images on previously unseen data, with an accuracy of around
96%. Therefore, the use of CNN in the recognition and classification of watermelon and
grape images yields satisfying results. The CNN model can well understand the visual
differences between the two types of fruits. Thus, CNN can be an effective tool in various
image processing and visual object recognition applications.
